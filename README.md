A simple and secure PHP script to help people find their perfect mate.

Demo located at [mm.s22.us](https://mm.s22.us/)

## Overview

This script started life as Robin's Nest from the "Learning PHP, MySQL, & JavaScript" book by https://github.com/RobinNixon but soon took on a life of it's own and now has become production worthy.  I plan to take this a lot further with the help of the GitHub community, however the underlying philosophy of secure, self-contained, and lightweight will always remain.

The look and feel can be changed in a flash simply by replacing the bootstrap file with your choice from https://bootswatch.com
